# flutter_content

For Flutter developers, this package allows you to create callouts programmatically, and also using an interactive design tool, where you set a target position, "record" a transformation, design the callout, and capture the configuration as JSON. Your app will use that JSON with this API.

This is an initial upload to create the pkg on pub.dev.
